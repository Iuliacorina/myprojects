Having the lowest error values (MAE Test) and the highest R² scores (R² Test), it is clear that this model provides the best prediction on the test set. Among the 3 random forest models, the experiment on the third data set performs the best (Test MAE:4.419800, R²:0.156700). However, the tuned random forest model is the best performer, with the smallest mean absolute error (4.350100) and the highest R2 value (0.221200). \n",
